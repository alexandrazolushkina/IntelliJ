## Managing tasks in IntelliJ IDEA

When you are developing, it is important to organize the activities necessary to do
your work. Know which tasks should be done and mark something less essential for
later. This could help you focus and, consequently, make things easy and fast. IntelliJ
provides tools that can be used to organize your activities.
