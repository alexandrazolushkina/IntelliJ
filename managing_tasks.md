## Managing Tasks in IntelliJ IDEA

IntelliJ IDEA features a set of tools that can help you manage your activities more efficiently. 

As you work on a project, it may be essential for you to organize the entire scope of your work in smaller tasks. You will be able to focus on more important pieces of work and porstpone less important. You will also get a chance to monitor tasks that have been set for you in your issue tracker, and update these issues right from IntelliJ IDEA.
