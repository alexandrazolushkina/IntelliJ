## Tasks and Contexts in IntelliJ IDEA

When you work on a project, you can organize your work in smaller tasks that you need to complete. These can be tasks coming from your issue tracker, or tasks that you set yourself. A task always has a name, or an ID.  

Each task may have a number of files opened in the editor that are linked with this task. In IntelliJ IDEA, this set of files is called _context_. 

If you need to switch to another task within the same project, you can simply save the task you are working on together with its context to return to it later and continue you work. The next time you open the task, IntelliJ IDEA will restore all tabs and layout just the way you left it. Moreover, a task can be opened in a separate context.

A _task_ is an activity that you perform in IntelliJ IDEA. 

_Context_ is a set of files or tabs you need to work on a task. 

In IntelliJ IDEA, there two types of tasks:

* Tasks that were originally created in IntelliJ IDEA. These are _local tasks_.
* Tasks that were loaded to IntelliJ IDEA from your issue tracker. These are _tracker tasks_.
Tracker tasks are linked with the corresponding issues in your issue tracker. It allows you to monitor and update them directly form IntelliJ IDEA. 

If you want to work with your issues directly from IntelliJ IDEA, ![connect the IDE to your issue tracker account](https://github.com/alexandrazolushkina/IntelliJ/blob/master/tracker_integration.md).
