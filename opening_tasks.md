# Opening Tasks

If you have at least one crated task of either type, a special drop-down list on the toolbar becomes available. This list is called _tasks combo_. As long as you have no created tasks, the tasks combo will be hidden. 

Use the tasks combo to navigate and manage your tasks. 

On the picture below, the tasks combo is marked with a red arrow.

## Opening Tracker Tasks 

Tracker tasks are loaded to your IntelliJ IDEA once you connect it to your issue tracker. 

To open a tracker task:
1. Open the list of available tasks:
* Navigate to **Tools** > **Tasks & Contexts** > **Open Task**, or
* Click the tasks combo on the toolbar.
2. In the **Open Task** dialog, select the necessary task.

Tracker tasks are marked with the ![](https://github.com/alexandrazolushkina/IntelliJ/blob/master/tracker_task.png) icon in the tasks combo. They have the light-purple background color until they are opened in IntelliJ IDEA. After a tracker issue is opened in IntelliJ IDEA, its background color changes to white.

When you open a task, the **Open Task** dialog will prompt you to change task configuration: 

**Update issue information** — (available only for tracker tasks) select this check box if you want to update issue state and then select a new task state from the drop-down list.<br>
**Clear current context** — select this check box if you want to clear the context associated with this task.<br>
  > **VCS operations** (available only when version control is enabled in your project)<br>

**Create branch <branch name> from <base branch name>** — select this check box to create a new branch from the existing one.<br>
**Use branch** — select this check box to use the existing branch.<br>
**Create changelist** — select this check box to have IntelliJ IDEA create a new changelist for the specified task. By default, the text field shows the issue tracker item's description. 

### Creating Local Tasks

In IntelliJ IDEA, you can create local tasks that are not displayed in your issue tracker.
To create local tasks:
1. Open the **Open Task** dialog: 
* From the main menu, select **Tools** > **Tasks & Contexts** > **Open Task**
* Press **SHIFT**+**ALT**+**N**
* Click the tasks combo on the main toolbar
2. In the **Enter task name** pop-up window, choose **Create New Task**, or just type a task name. 

In the tasks combo, local tasks are marked with the ![](https://github.com/alexandrazolushkina/IntelliJ/blob/master/local_task.png) icon, and always have the white background color.

## Viewing Closed Tasks

You can force IntelliJ IDEA to display already closed tasks. 

A _closed local task_ is a task that is not associated with a changelist provided that the entire project or the affected directory is under version control. <br>
For more information, refer to [Associating a Project Root with a Version Control System](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/associating-a-project-root-with-a-version-control-system.html) and 
[Associating a Directory with a Specific Version Control System](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/associating-a-directory-with-a-specific-version-control-system.html).

A _closed tracker task_ is a tracker task that has the closed status in your issue tracker. <br>
To view closed tasks, select the **Include closed tasks** check box or press **SHIFT**+**ALT**+**N**.

After you have opened the necessary tasks, you can easily [manage them](https://github.com/alexandrazolushkina/IntelliJ/blob/master/working_with_tasks.md).
