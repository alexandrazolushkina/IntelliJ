# Viewing Task Description

When you are choosing a task to switch to, the list in the **Switch to** task pop-up window shows only IDs of tasks and their summaries. This information is not always sufficient, because it reflects neither the steps that lead to the problem nor the related discussion.

You can learn more about your current task in two ways.

* View the description of a task in a pop-up window:

  From the main menu, select **Tools** > **Tasks & Contexts** > **Show '_task ID_' Description**.

* Open a task in the browser and view both the issue description and all the comments on it:

  From the main menu, select **Tools** > **Tasks & Contexts** > **Open '_task ID_' in Browser**.
