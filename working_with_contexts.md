# Working with Contexts in IntelliJ IDEA

## Saving and Clearing Contexts

With IntelliJ IDEA, you can save and clear contexts without associating them with specific tasks. 
To manage the current context independently from a task, do one of the following:

* To save the current context, choose **Tools** > **Tasks & Contexts** > **Save Context** on the main menu.
* To clear the current context without loading another one, choose **Tools** > **Tasks & Contexts** > **Clear Context** on the main menu.

## Switching Between Contexts

With IntelliJ IDEA, you can switch between contexts that are not associated with specific tasks.

To switch to another context:

1. From the main menu, select **Tools** > **Tasks & Contexts** > **Load Context**, or press **SHIFT**+**ALT**+**L**.
2. In the **Load Context** pop-up window, select the necessary context from the list.
